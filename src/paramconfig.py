# Regarding the crime what_type
# The parameters are based on the severity of the punishment, given under the  Criminal Code Finland.
# Since they are different crimes under each category, we consider the most severe of the crime_types in that category
# and base the score on that. There are 5 severety categories with life_offences having the highest punishment
# (i.e., life imprisonment), gets a importance of 5. Next is crimes sentenced a max of 10 years which get a score of 4,
# then others that have 4 years, 2 years, and 0 years that get a score of 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
